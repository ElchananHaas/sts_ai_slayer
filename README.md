This is a package for designing and experimenting with AI for playing Slay the Spire fights and games. 

This reasonably reproduces the Slay the Spire fights, cards, relics and map generation. It also
provides convenient representations of the battle and action states to machine learning algorithms.
Additionally, it allows for re-randmizing game state at any point to allow for unbiased simulations. 
This works even in the middle of a fight.

It is a non-goal to reproduce the random number generation in Slay the Spire. It is also not a planned 
goal to add any GUI. There may be some inaccuracies regarding relic and effect ordering in addition 
to other bugs. These will be fixed as they are found, but are not a priority as long as they have a 
minimal effect on gameplay.
