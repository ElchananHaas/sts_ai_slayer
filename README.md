This is a package for designing and experimenting with AI for playing Slay the Spire fights and games. 

Goals and non goals:

There is a goal to reasonably reproduce the Slay the Spire fights, cards, relics and map generation. 
Another goal is to provide convenient representations of the battle and action states to machine learning
algorithms. I also plan to allow for re-randmizing game state at any point to allow for unbiased simulations.

It is a non-goal to reproduce the random number generation in Slay the Spire. It is also not a planned goal to add any GUI. There may be some inaccuracies regarding relic and effect ordering in addition to other bugs. These will be fixed as they are found, but are not a priority as long as they have a minimal effect on gameplay.
